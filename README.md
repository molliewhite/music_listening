# Project 2 Proposal (Rough)

We will look at music and see which artists have contributed the most to their genre being popular. Data has been sampled and scraped from the RIAA certification website. The sample pulls from the highest certifications. We have built an interactive chart that will show the certifications by genre, then by artist, then by album for each artist. There is also a filter to change by on the format, due to the popularity of streaming services, from album to single.
